- **Event Editing**: Fixed "Invalid time value" error when editing events by adding safe date parsing with proper validation
- **CFP Submissions API**: Fixed 500 error by adding missing `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to `cfp_submissions` table
- **EditEventModal**: Fixed missing imports (`cn`, `Checkbox`, and `format`) that were causing ReferenceError crashes
- **Event Creator Tracking**: Fixed missing `created_by_id` field by automatically populating it with the authenticated user's database ID when creating events

## Development Notes

### Recent Fixes (Current Session)
- **Linting Errors**: Fixed all TypeScript linting errors in server files
  - Proper error handling with type guards
  - Fixed CSV column mapping type assertions
  - Resolved Vite import issues with TypeScript ignore comments
  - Fixed Node.js compatibility issues with `__dirname` vs `import.meta.dirname`

- **Asset Management**: Fixed property access issues in frontend

  - Added proper type assertions for server-enhanced objects

- **Deployment Issues**: Resolved various deployment problems
  - Fixed invalid image reference with double slashes
  - Added Docker Hub pull secrets for base image authentication
  - Fixed environment variable export issues in deployment scripts

### Known Issues
- Users page currently shows only 1 user (David Simmons) - may need additional user seeding
- Some Keycloak integration features may need further testing
- File upload size limits and type restrictions may need adjustment based on usage

### Next Steps
- **Documentation Expansion**
  - Complete user documentation: CFP submissions, file uploads, user profile, approval workflows
  - Create admin documentation: user management, event review, system settings, backup/restore procedures
  - Develop developer documentation: API endpoints, database schema details, local setup, configuration guide, security practices
  - Add general documentation: system requirements, complete changelog, comprehensive troubleshooting
- Add more comprehensive user management features
- Implement bulk operations for events and assets
- Add advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Enhance reporting and analytics features
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add automated testing suite
- **MinIO Integration**: Currently not in use - decide to either implement fully or remove
  - Application uses direct PVC storage at `/app/uploads` (10Gi)
  - MinIO deployment exists but is not integrated into application code
  - Options: (1) Implement S3-compatible MinIO storage, or (2) Remove unused MinIO components
- **Keycloak Custom Domain Route**
  - Create OpenShift route for `keycloak-prod.rh-events.org` with Let's Encrypt certificate
  - Run created script: `create-keycloak-prod-route.sh` (if still exists)
  - Verify DNS configuration points to OpenShift router
